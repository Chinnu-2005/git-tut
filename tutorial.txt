Git and Github Tutorial

Git is Version Control System (VCS) that helps you track changes in your code. It's a powerful tool that
allows you to collaborate with others, revert to previous versions of your code, and more. It is offline.

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It allows you to host and share your
code with others, as well as collaborate on projects.  
It acts as remote Repository hosting service for free of cost.
There are many other remote repository hosting services like GitLab, Bitbucket etc.
